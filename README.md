# Implementation-of-Decision-Tree-Regressor-Model-for-Predicting-the-Salary-of-the-Employee

## Aim:
To write a program to implement the Decision Tree Regressor Model for Predicting the Salary of the Employee.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Jupyter notebook

## Algorithm
1. Import the required packages.
2. Read the data set.
3. Apply label encoder to the non-numerical column inoreder to convert into numerical values.
4. Determine training and test data set.
5. Apply decision tree regression on to the dataframe and get the values of Mean square error, r2 and data prediction.

## Program:
